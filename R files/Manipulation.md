# Data cleaning

This page guides you through basic data cleaning methods in R, using clear and practical examples. As you follow along, you will see how each technique works and why it is useful for preparing your data for analysis. You will learn how to:

- **Select variables** from a dataset to work with a subsample of data.
- **Create dummy variables** from categorical responses.  
- **Generate and recode categorical variables**, including grouping values and adding descriptive labels.  
- **Filter data** based on conditions (similar to Stataâ€™s `keep if`).  
- **Create variables conditionally** on other variables' values.  
- Perform **basic arithmetic operations** on variables.  
- **Handle missing values** by removing rows with `NA`s in key fields.  

By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to clean raw data. You will do this using R's `dplyr` library, which you can load into your R session by running the following command:
```r
library(dplyr)
```
## Select a subsample of data
Before starting our data cleaning, we select only a subsample of variables from our dataset. We keep only three variables:

- `vote`: whether the respondent voted  
- `agea`: age of respondent  
- `eisced`: education level (ES-ISCED classification)

and save them into the dataframe `df_cleaned`, using the function `select()`:

```r
df_cleaned<-select(df, vote, agea, eisced)
```

## Generate Dummy Variable
A dummy variable is a binary indicator that takes a value of 1 or 0. Here, we create a dummy variable, `vote_variable`, which takes the value 1 if the respondent reports voting in the last elections and 0 otherwise. Before we begin, let us check the structure of the variable `vote` using the `tabulate()` command that we created in [How to create a function in R, and why should you do it?](https://gubellom.github.io/functions/):


```r
tabulate(df_cleaned$vote)
```

2                   No      9417      21.22      90.64
3 Not eligible to vote      3687       8.31      98.95
4              Refusal       250       0.56      99.51
5           Don't know       209       0.47      99.98
6            No answer         9       0.02     100.00
7                Total     44387     100.00         NA
  </pre>
</details>

We then check the values assigned to each label using the command `attr()`. Alternatively, one can use the command `table()`, which provides the value and the number of observations per value.

```r
attr(df_cleaned$vote, "labels")
```

                 Yes                   No Not eligible to vote              Refusal 
                   1                    2                    3                   NA

                  NA                   NA
  </pre>
</details>

We create a dummy variable, `vote_variable`, which takes the value 1 if a respondent voted in the last election, and 0 if the respondent did not vote or was not eligible to vote. NA values remain as NA values even in the new dummy variable.

```r
df_cleaned$vote_variable<-ifelse(df_cleaned$vote==1, 1, 0)
tabulate(df_cleaned$vote_variable)
```

4    Total     44387      99.99         NA
  </pre>
</details>

## Generate a categorical variable
Another important coding practice is generating a new categorical variable from an existing one. This is useful when you want to group a few categories because they have only a few observations, or when you want to simplify the categorical variable by creating broader categories.

We choose the variable `eisced`, which gives us the ISCED educational levels of each respondent. As before, we check the structure of the variable using the commands `tabulate()` and `attr()`.

```r
tabulate(df_cleaned$eisced)
```

Notice that while the category "*Not possible to harmonise into ES-ISCED*" exists, it has 0 observations and therefore does not appear in the output of `tabulate()` or `table()`. We can verify the number of observations in each category using the `sum()` command:

```r
sum(df_cleaned$eisced == 0, na.rm = TRUE)
```

We simplify our `eisced` variable by grouping it into three categories: (1) Lower education (ES-ISCED I, ES-ISCED II), (2) Middle education (ES-ISCED IIIb, ES-ISCED IIIa), and (3) Higher education (ES-ISCED IV, ES-ISCED V1, ES-ISCED V2). To do this, we use a *nested* `ifelse` function. An `ifelse` statement is a function that assigns a specific value if a condition is true, and another value if it is false. It is called *nested* because multiple `ifelse` functions are combined within one another. Notice that `%in%` can be read as "*belongs to the vector*". Essentially, we can read the first line of code as: *If the value in `df_cleaned$eisced` is 1 or 2, assign value 1 to `df_cleaned$education`*. The other lines follow a similar logic.

```r
# Use nested ifelse
df_cleaned$education <- ifelse(df_cleaned$eisced %in% c(1, 2), 1,     # If the value in df_cleaned$eisced takes value 1 or 2, assign value 1 to df_cleaned$education
                        ifelse(df_cleaned$eisced %in% c(3, 4), 2,
                        ifelse(df_cleaned$eisced %in% c(5, 6, 7), 3, NA)))
tabulate(df_cleaned$education)
```

Numbers are replaced with descriptive labels for easier interpretation:  

- `Education: lower`  
- `Education: middle`  
- `Education: higher`  

  
```r
#We also relabel education
df_cleaned <- df_cleaned %>%
  mutate(education = case_when(
    education == 1 ~ "Education: lower",
    education == 2 ~ "Education: middle",
    education == 3 ~ "Education: higher",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))
tabulate(df_cleaned$education)
```

## Keep a subset of the original data that meets certain conditions
 
Stata equivalent to `keep if`. We keep only respondents between 15 and 65 years old to focus on the working-age population and exclude outliers.

```r
summary(df_cleaned$agea)
```

<details>
  <summary>[Output]</summary>
  <pre>
Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
15.00   34.00   49.00   49.14   64.00  100.00     155 
  </pre>
</details>

```r
df_cleaned <- filter(df_cleaned, agea>=15 & agea<=65)
summary(df_cleaned$agea)
```
<details>
  <summary>[Output]</summary>
  <pre>
 Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
15.00   30.00   43.00   41.96   54.00   65.00 
  </pre>
</details>

## Create variable conditional to another variable

```r
df_cleaned<-mutate(df_cleaned, no_vote_18 =ifelse(vote==3 & agea<18, 1, 0))
tabulate(df_cleaned$no_vote_18)
```

## Basic operations

We transform age with simple operations:

- Divide by 100 â†’ `age_100`  
- Multiply by 100 â†’ `age_times_100`  


```r
#Divide age by 100
df_cleaned$age_100<-df_cleaned$agea/100
df_cleaned$age_times_100<-df_cleaned$agea*100
```

<details>
  <summary>[Output]</summary>
  <pre>
summary(df_cleaned$age_100)
Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
0.1500  0.3000  0.4300  0.4196  0.5400  0.6500 

summary(df_cleaned$age_times_100)
Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
1500    3000    4300    4196    5400    6500 
  </pre>
</details>

## Remove all the missing values row for vote

We drop all rows where `vote` is missing to ensure a clean dataset for analysis.

```r
df_cleaned <- filter(df_cleaned, !is.na(vote))
tabulate(df_cleaned$vote)
```
