I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.esri.ie/people/michele-gubello">Economic and Social Research Institute, Dublin</a>, a Visiting Research Fellow at Trinity College Dublin and a member of the <a href="https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview/country-by-country/detail?id=10">Irish EUROMOD Team</a>. In 2025, I was also an external lecturer in Public Economics at Maynooth University. <br>
<br>
My research focuses on the intersection of public economics, political economy, health and socioeconomics. In my research I combine economic theory, econometric and microsimulation analysis to explore how institutions, public policy design, and social capital shape socioeconomic and political outcomes.
